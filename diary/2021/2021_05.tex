onCreateView():

After the onCreate() is called (in the Fragment), the Fragment's onCreateView() is called. You can assign your View variables and do any graphical initialisations. You are expected to return a View from this method, and this is the main UI view, but if your Fragment does not use any layouts or graphics, you can return null (happens by default if you don't override).

Noah and were looking for my bug. And the conclusion was that the proble is how the RecyclerView is invoket in the MainActivity. The other problem is i can't 
copie it from the programm I used to. So I will look out how you use onCreatView in the Fragment or in oure term I think it is AppCompatActivity but that is not a Fragment so 
I have to look up somethings.
