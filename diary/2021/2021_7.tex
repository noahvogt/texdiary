I'm reading a book right now about Database and I'm making the setting Fragment. The Recyclerviewer is a little bit annoying 
because I don't want to make a pop-up Window but I don't know how to get rid of the Recyclerviewer. And I'm not sure in what design 
I want to make the Settings. Also i should borrow a Book for Interface Standarts.
